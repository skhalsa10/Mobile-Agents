# Project: Mobile Agents
## Student(s):  Michelle Louie, Siri Khalsa

## Introduction
This application solves the Mobile Agents spec provided as a project 4 in cs 351 at UNM

## Contributions
This is a group project. We both worked very closely togethor on design decisions. Michelle primarily worked on most of the simulation related classes.
really complex classes like Node, Agent, Forrest and most other simulation related. Siri worked mostly on the GUI. Most classes in teh Graphics folder.
and primarily the GUI class. We both worked on the Messages.

## Usage
Give details about how to use the program. (Imagine making it easy for someone that you don't know to run and use your project.)

## Project Assumptions
1. We assume that we can only have one base station and one node on fire to start the sim.
2. If a config file contains multiple bases and fire we pick one of each and ignore the rest.
3. If the config file has duplicate nodes or edges it will write out an error and exit the application.
4. Although the assignment states that the sensor network is represented as a planar graph, 
we DO NOT check to see if it is a valid planar graph and we wil accept a graph with edges that cross the path of 
other edges. The simulation still functions correctly.

## Versions 
The jar file can be found wher
### V1
explain about how version 1 works


## Docs
What folder is your documentation (diagram and class diagram) in?

## Status
### Implemented Features
State things that work.

### Known Issues
If there are things that don't work put them here. It will save the graders time and keep them in a good mood.

## Testing and Debugging
If you have tests, then explain how they work and how to use them.
